# Sifone
Sifone is a high-contrast display typeface.

The inspiration comes from 8 hand-drawn Chinese specimens from a 1994 newspaper clipping. The original tagline "柔软顺滑来自诗芳", which translates to "soft and smooth comes from Sifone", was made for a shampoo brand. 

This Latin typeface aims to preserve the quirky and bouncy quality of the specimens and explore the possibility of bilingual design. For more information, visit https://www.jozixuan.com/
